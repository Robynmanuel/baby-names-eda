**Baby Names EDA Project**

Exploratory Data Analysis on Popular Baby Names Dataset
(Wolfram Language / Mathematica)


**Project Overview**

This project explores and analyzes a Popular Baby Names dataset using Wolfram Language. The analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to baby naming preferences across different ethnicities, genders, and time periods.

The project is structured to show iterative development and maintainability â€” making use of Git version control for tracking updates and improvements.


**Tools & Technologies**

Wolfram Language / Mathematica.

Popular Baby Names Dataset.

Git & GitHub for version control.

Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Visualization.


**Dataset Description**

**Attribute	Description**

Child's First Name:	Name of the baby.

Gender:	FEMALE / MALE.

Ethnicity:	Ethnic group classification.

Year of Birth:	Year the baby was born.

Count:	Number of babies with that name in that year.

Rank:	Popularity rank of the name within its group.


**Analysis Goals**

Determine the most popular names by Ethnicity and Gender.

Analyze name trends across multiple years.

Identify names that appear across multiple ethnicities.

Investigate gender-neutral or unisex names.

Explore patterns within specific ethnic groups (e.g., Hispanic-only names).
